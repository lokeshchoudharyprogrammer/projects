# Monorepo Overview

Welcome to the official repository for my full suite of applications. This monorepo is structured to house multiple projects, including web applications, mobile applications, shared libraries, and personal portfolio. By leveraging a monorepo architecture, we streamline code reuse, enhance maintainability, and optimize deployment pipelines for both web and mobile environments.

## Shared Libraries

The monorepo includes several shared libraries to facilitate code reuse across projects, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.

- **UI Components** (`libs/ui-components/`): A shared library of reusable UI components, designed for use across both web and mobile applications.
- **Utilities** (`libs/utils/`): A collection of utility functions and helpers that streamline common operations, shared across all applications.
- **API Client** (`libs/api-client/`): A robust API client that abstracts HTTP requests and error handling, enabling seamless integration with the API service across different projects.

## Development Workflow

Each project in this monorepo has its own development environment, but the following practices are recommended for consistency:

- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and Husky are set up for consistent code formatting and linting across projects.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests are written using Jest and Cypress for comprehensive test coverage. Each app can run its tests individually using:
  ```bash
  yarn test:<project>
  ```
- **Version Control**: All changes are managed via Git and should follow the [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model. Feature branches should be merged via pull requests after code review.

---

## Continuous Integration & Deployment

The repository is integrated with a robust CI/CD pipeline for testing, building, and deploying all applications:

- **Web Application**: Automatically deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) after successful builds on the `main` branch.
- **Mobile Application**: Built and distributed to the [Apple App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) via [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/).
- **API Service**: Deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) using continuous deployment on successful test runs.
- **Admin Dashboard & Analytics Tool**: Deployed via [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) after passing tests.
